## Lily

Over five million women become pregnant every year in the United States. These women must monitor information such as weight gain, water intake, and heart rate. They will report this information at over fifteen prenatal obstetrician (OB) visits throughout their pregnancies. Thus, there is an increased need for real-time monitoring and journaling of healthcare information during this incredibly important phase in a woman’s life.


### What is Lily?

 Lily is a mobile health solution which pairs with a Fitbit® product to track pregnancy-specific health information. Lily also addresses the other health-related challenges women experience during pregnancy, such as remembering to journal questions for an OB, drinking water, and reducing stress.
